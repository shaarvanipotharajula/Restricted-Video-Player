# ðŸŽ¬ Restricted Video Player (React)

A simple **React application** that plays a video with **restricted controls** â€” designed for cases where you want viewers to watch a video **without skipping, downloading, or changing playback speed**.

Only **volume control** and **time display** are allowed.

This project demonstrates how to create a **custom video player** in React that:
- Restricts default HTML video controls.
- Disables skip, download, and playback speed options.
- Allows only:
  - **Play / Pause**
  - **Volume control**
  - **Current time & total duration display**

This ensures a **controlled viewing experience** while keeping a clean UI.
